## 🌌 Overview

**AstrisJS** is a next-generation framework built on top of [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/), designed to provide a robust, scalable, and type-safe structure for your Discord applications.

Born from the need for a more structured way to build bots, AstrisJS handles the heavy lifting of command management, event handling, and modular architecture, letting you focus on creating unique features.

### ✨ Key Features

- **TypeScript First:** Built with TypeScript for TypeScript. Enjoy full type safety and amazing IntelliSense.
- **Modern Stack:** Optimized for **Bun** runtime, but fully compatible with Node.js.
- **Hybrid Support:** Works seamlessly with both ESM (`import`) and CommonJS (`require`).
- **Scalable Architecture:** Opinionated structures for Commands and Events to keep your codebase clean.
